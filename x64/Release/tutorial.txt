-----Hey, welcome to Shooty!-----

    Its pretty simple.

-----:Controls:-----
        Movement is simple, good ol' WASD. If you were able to somehow download this, then I'm gonna assume you know how to use them.
        Now Attacking, thats a bit complex. You click. Bam, a bullet happens. And guess what? Right clicking also does a thing! A directional
        dash will launch you in the direction you are facing, damaging your oponents, and making you invincible. Its mandatory to dodge the
        circle guys, so I'd recommend using it. Its also the most interesting part of the game.
        
        Points are a thing. Enemies are worth base point values. These values are multiplied by the current multiplier, and then add to
        your score. Multiplier increments every five kills, or on contact with an enemy while dashing.
        
        Pretty much just shoot and dodge.
        
        TL;DR
        
        Up ---- W
        Left -- A
        Down -- S
        Right - D
        
        Right-Click - Shoot
        Left-Click -- Dash (Makes you invulnerable, damages enemies and increases multiplier on contact, three uses, refills on hitting an enemy (1), or getting hit (3))
        
        Esc - Pause
        Space (During points screen) - Advance
        
-----:Enemy Overview:-----
